## What's Next?
The following will be available later this week:

- #### New AdvantageKit Swerve Templates
    In the **[Kick-Off Release of AdvantageKit (V4.0.0)](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit/releases/tag/v4.0.0)**, the AdvantageKit Swerve Templates have received several upgrades. We will be integrating these upgrades into **[our modified version of AdvantageKit Swerve Templates with Maple-Sim integration](https://shenzhen-robotics-alliance.github.io/maple-sim/#getting-started-with-templates)** so that teams can easily use them for the new season.

- #### CTRE Generated Swerve Project Simulation Support
    We will provide a modified version of the [CTRE Generated Swerve Project](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/api-reference/mechanisms/swerve/swerve-overview.html) to allow teams using it to take full advantage of Maple-Sim's enhanced simulation capabilities.

*Note: This is Maple-Sim's first season. The development process will **continue** as teams use it throughout the season. Expect occasional instability, bugs, and API changes as we deliver updates.
